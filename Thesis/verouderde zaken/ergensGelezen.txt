The starting point of Helmholtz's ap-
proach is his consonance curve. 
Imag-
ine two instruments playing a note in
unison. 
If one of the frequencies is
slowly increased, one will hear a beat-
ing.
 First it is slow, but it b e c o m e s
quicker and "more unpleasant". 
Helm-
holtz quantified this sensation by asso-
ciating a "degree of unpleasentness": if
the n u m b e r of beats is x, then r
mea-
sures the "unpleasantness". 
Obviously
one has ~ 0 ) = 0, and qualitatively it is
clear that ~ will first increase up to an
m a x i m u m (which is assumed to be
around x = 30) and then decrease.

In order to have a mathematically
simple representation of ~p, Helmholtz
chose ~ x ) = ax/(30 + x2) 2, a choice
which of course is somewhat arbitrary.
This ~ is used to explain consonance as
follows. 
If two instruments play an in-
terval, one has to sum u p the q>-values
which belong to every pair of frequen-
cies from the list of all pitches which oc-
cur in the Fourier expansion of the two
notes which constitute the interval.

The result is a rather rough curve
with m i n i m u m zero at the frequency ra-
tios 1:1 and 2:1. 
But, remarkably, there
are also s o m e steep valleys in the graph
at 3:2, 5:4, and the other ratios which
c o r r e s p o n d to the Pythagorean scale.
